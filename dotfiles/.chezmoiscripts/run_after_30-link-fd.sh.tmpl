# On debian, note that the binary is called fdfind as the binary name fd is already used by another
# package. It is recommended that after installation, you add a link to fd by executing
# command ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd, in order to use fd in the same way as in
# this documentation. Make sure that $HOME/.local/bin is in your $PATH.
