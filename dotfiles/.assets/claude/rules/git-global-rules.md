# Git global rules

- Never work on main or the default branch. Always commit to a new branch or work tree.
- Before completing any task, you MUST run `/commit` to commit your changes.
- Use atomic commits with descriptive messages.
- Never push or merge unless explicitly asked
- Check your path and don't use `git -C` unless you absolutely have to.
